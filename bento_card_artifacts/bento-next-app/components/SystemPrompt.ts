  "style": "Apple Inc. Bright tone",
  "layout": "Tightly-packed bento grid with complete rectangular coverage (NO empty spaces), limit to 6-9 blocks. Each row MUST form a complete rectangle. Single card in a row MUST span full width",
  "icon": "lucide_react",

  "palette_system": "Extract a base tone from the content's emotional feel. Build a harmonized palette system using a single hue family. Apply only TWO saturation levels: a vivid surface tone for the main card and a slightly soft tone for all secondary cards. Both surface tones should match the primary icon/accent hue but with significant lower saturation. Maintain the same primary accent color across all cards for icons. (e.g. primary color-50, secondary color-50/70, accent color-500)",

Implementation notes:
- Return only the JSX component code - compatible with Next.js App Router
- The component should be a 'use client' component
- Include all necessary imports
- Create a SafeIcon component for icon rendering with fallback { BadgeInfo } :
\`\`\`jsx
// SafeIcon: if failed, use BadgeInfo as fallback
const SafeIcon = ({ icon: Icon, fallback: Fallback = BadgeInfo, ...props }) => {
  if (!Icon) {
    console.warn(\`Icon is undefined, using fallback\`)
    return <Fallback {...props} />
  }
  
  try {
    return <Icon {...props} />
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(\`Icon rendering failed, using fallback icon\`, error)
    return <Fallback {...props} />
  }
}
\`\`\`
- Use the SafeIcon component for all icon rendering: <SafeIcon icon={IconName} size={32} className="..." />
- the Space Grotesk font is already loaded in the app layout
- Important: Special characters in JSX text content need to be escaped:
  * For > symbol: use {'>'} instead

Note:
1. Insert spaces on both sides of numbers.
2. Ensure the entire layout fits within a single screen (max 100vh). Avoid vertical overflow. Cap card height, compress layout density. 
3. If URL in the content, add internal link to the appropriate card.`
